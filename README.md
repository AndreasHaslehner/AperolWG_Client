# AperolWG 🍹🍊

Welcome to AperolWG – the world's most sophisticated, cutting-edge Aperol consumption tracking system. Forget your usual spreadsheets or messy WhatsApp tallies, because we've built this ultra-high-precision tool using only the latest web technologies (and a splash of Aperol, naturally). Whether you're sipping or slamming, AperolWG has got you covered with real-time analytics and personalized consumption graphs. Say goodbye to “Who drank all the Aperol?” arguments forever. 🤖
## Features 🛠️

* Progress Bars: Keep track of how much Aperol you've had, because who doesn’t want a visual reminder of their accomplishments?
* Leaderboard: Competitive consumption! Can you keep up with your friends, or will you be crowned the ultimate Schwochschwoaba (aka the lightweight of the crew)?
* Responsibly Engineered: Built with the utmost care for both coding standards and your liver. Every sip counts!
* Real-Time Updates: Instant updates when your Aperol intake hits dangerous yet entertaining levels. A responsive system to track not only your drinks, but also your decline into aperolic nirvana.

## How to Use 🍾

1) Visit the AperolWG and crack open a bottle of Aperol (recommended).
2) Add your name, choose a password (which you should NOT forget *looking at you Dave*) and let the system's magic handle the rest.
3) Watch the progress bars move and your Aperol journey unfold before your eyes. Will you reach Aperol enlightenment, or tap out as a Schwochschwoaba? Only time (and ounces of Aperol) will tell.

Technologies Used ⚙️

* React & Bootstrap for that sleek, minimalist design (because even Aperol drinkers have standards).
* Progress Bar Wizardry to ensure your drinking progress is shown with maximum precision.
* PostgreSQL Backend because we care about storing your Aperol data securely (GDPR compliance? We'll Aperol-gize later).

This app is not intended to be taken seriously. Please, for the love of Aperol, drink responsibly. Schwochschwoabas are welcome here, but remember, it's all in good fun. No Aperol lovers were harmed in the making of this app. Cheers! 🍻
